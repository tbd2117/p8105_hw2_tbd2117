### Problem 1

Reading and cleaning Mr. Trash Wheel Dataset

``` r
mr_trash_df = 
  read_excel("./data/MR_Trash_Wheel.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
  
professor_trash_df = 
  read_excel("./data/MR_Trash_Wheel.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N80") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))

captain_trash_df = 
  read_excel("./data/MR_Trash_Wheel.xlsx", sheet = "Captain Trash Wheel", range = "A2:k20") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

Read and clean precipitation data for 2017 and 2018. For each, omit rows
without precipitation data and add a variable year.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_excel("./data/MR_Trash_Wheel.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = "2018") %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name)

precip_2017 = 
  read_excel("./data/MR_Trash_Wheel.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = "2017") %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name)
```

Next, combine precipitation datasets and convert month to a character
variable (the variable month.name is built into R and should be useful).

``` r
precipitation =
  bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in both resulting datasets,
and give examples of key variables. For available data, what was the
total precipitation in 2018? What was the median number of sports balls
in a dumpster in 2017?

The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33in.

``` r
# median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017
dumpster_2017 =
  filter(mr_trash_df, year == "2017")

# total precipitation in 2018
sum(pull(precip_2018, total))
```

    ## [1] 70.33

The median number of sports balls in the *Mr. Trash Wheel* dumpster in
2017 was 8.

``` r
mr_trash_2017 = 
  filter(mr_trash_df, year == "2017")

median(pull(mr_trash_2017, sports_balls))
```

    ## [1] 8

``` r
sum()
```

    ## [1] 0
